		<h2>About WINNER</h2>
		<p>WINNER is four-member South Korean boy band that was formed in 2013 by YG Entertainment through Mnet survival program WIN: Who Is Next leading to their official debut on August 17, 2014 with studio album 2014 S/S. Originally a five-piece band, Taehyun, departed from the group in November 2016 for his mental health and well-being. Upon their debut, The Korea Herald cited their immediate success as "unprecedented" for a new group, thus dubbed as "Monster rookies". WINNER is often cited as a "self-producing" band with all members actively taking on roles from producing and choreographing to designing and marketing.</p>
